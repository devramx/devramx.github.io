Recently, while doing some woodworking, I found myself relying on a jig. With it, I could cut large boards or assemble parts in a way that was faster, more precise, and—most importantly—repeatable. One careful setup meant I could produce identical pieces over and over.

That’s when it clicked: software development has its own version of jigs. In woodworking, a jig is a guide that shapes or controls the process so you don’t need to measure and improvise every time. In software, we create tools, patterns, and processes that serve the same purpose. They help us cut once, ship many—ensuring consistency, reducing errors, and speeding up delivery.

Consider a few examples:
	•	Code Templates & Generators: Tools like create-next-app or Go project scaffolds provide a starting structure that enforces conventions.
	•	Testing Frameworks: Unit test harnesses are jigs for validation, guaranteeing every “cut” is tested the same way.
	•	CI/CD Pipelines: Automated builds, linting, and deployments ensure integration and delivery happen reliably, no matter the contributor.
	•	Design Patterns: MVC, Factory, or Observer act as conceptual jigs, proven solutions to recurring problems.
	•	Infrastructure as Code: Terraform or Ansible scripts build identical environments repeatedly, just like cutting uniform boards for a frame.

The principle is universal: repeatability, reliability, and speed. A seasoned woodworker knows when to pause and build a jig, just as an experienced developer knows when to invest in tooling or automation.

In both crafts, jigs turn skill into a system. They free us from redoing the basics so we can focus on the creative and challenging parts of the work—the parts where craftsmanship truly shines.
